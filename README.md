## Welcome to TODOList

Your application to friendly manage your tasks and keep everything in order!

### How to use it

TODOList saves tasks by user, so what you first have to do is to sign up entering a nickname, an e-mail and a password. Or you can log in directly from Google.
If you decide to give a valid e-mail to create an account, you will be able to reset your password if you forget it or simply want to change it.

Once you are registerd and logged in, you will be redirected to the main page. The interface is very simple: you will find an input field for you to enter a description for your task. Then, you will have four different colors to choose for customizing it. Thanks to this, you will be able to assign levels or types of task depending on the linked color. Finally, you will be prompted to enter a task date, starting by the day after the current one. All these inputs are mandatory in order to ensure consistent data.

It couldn´t be simpler!

### Manage your tasks

Nevertheless, that doesn´t finish here. As long as you create your tasks, they will be shown as a list of cards containing the description, the selected color and the date in the format of the time left to to reach it. So you will have a quick and qualitative view for you pending 'TODOes'. To help this, they are sorted from the nearest to the furthest one.

### More control tools

Also, you have a couple of icons buttons on the top-right edge of every card. You will use them to complete or delete the task. When you select "Complete", the description sentence will be in green and crossed out. This will help you to quickly realize when something is done. On the other side, if a task is expired, you will see its description in red and with the word Expired between brackets at the end of the sentence.

That´s all! Play around and enjoy!
